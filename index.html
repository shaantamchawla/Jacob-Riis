But my husband's cousin and his wife told us of Bayard Street - a place that was supposed to be a paradise in all the madness. We were told of Hebrew flags, friendly faces, and the familiar sound of Yiddish being spoken in the marketplace. It isn't exactly as we had imagined it, but this is our home now, and we need to make the best of it for my children."</p>

                    <p class="lead">"I work for 14 hours a day, 6 days a week in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Some days, I can't even afford to buy stale bread. Everyone knows what they put in the bread - bed tick, mattress stuffing, things that even prisoners shouldn't be made to eat. But that bread killed my sister 4 years ago. We would eat it every day, and one day she became very ill. Within 2 weeks she was dead, and the doctor confirmed that it was due to excessive lead and inedible fibers from the mattress stuffing. A health inspector came around our neighborhood to make sure the food being sold was safe, but the health inspectors here don't do their jobs properly. For all I know, I could end up exactly like my sister did."</p>

But then the textile factory I was a bookkeeper at started demanding longer hours for the same wages. I couldn't keep up with it because of my arthritis. Now I find a place to sleep out here - near the tracks or on a sidewalk. All I've got is what you see me wearing right now."</p>

She had tuberculosis; I begged and pleaded with the doctor and the guards to let her through, but to no avail - they sent her back and I haven't heard from her since. We host lodgers for 3 to 5 cents per night in our tenement, and combined with my wages from being a cook, we get by alright."</p>

We only have enough money to buy books for one child, but my mother said she wanted us all to be educated, so we're sharing. My two older brothers used these same books to learn math and grammar. One day, I want to be rich enough to own one of the tenement buildings instead of living in them. There just isn't enough space for all of us. My grandpa told me that if I study hard, that dream will come true."</p>
